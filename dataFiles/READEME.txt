-----------RFCML data files ---------------------------
actCoords_ml.mat
	locations of the 165 SAs. in mm.
	(in ML CS, see Buddy email 8/18/23. swap x/y to get to M1B)
influenceFunctions_ml.mat
	inside, we find
		"interactionMat", which is the surface normal influence matrix
		"forceMat", which is the unit load force sets
		(forces are in N, and displacements are in nanometers)
SVD_ml.mat
	U, S, V matrices from the SVD of "interactionMat" above
nodeCoords_ml.mat
	surface node coordinates, in mm.
	(in ML CS, see Buddy email 8/18/23. swap x/y to get to M1B)
saID_ml.txt
	SA IDs in the same order that they appear in the ML matrices.
	(Bo created this file by matching x and y locations if actCoords.mat to GMT SA locations.)
gmt3_final_forces_english.xlsx
	initial actuator forces calculated by Steve West @RFCML
	actuator coordinates in inch.
	CS used is one of the RFCML CSs. I call it SW CS. Swap x/y to get to M1B.
	Actuator IDs may not be the same as GMT's.
	---> Forces for GMT actuators: initialForces.csv
-----------GMT data files -----------------------------
utility_mapping_M1B_labels-16-Feb-2023.xlsx
	locations of the 170 SAs, types, max and min forces, air groups, etc. Do not use data from any other tabs, such as "HP"

	original location: OneDrive-SharedLibraries-GMTOCorp/M1S Portal - Documents/2.4 Utilities/03. Utilities Distribution/
Afz-13-Apr-2023.csv
	Afz = Fz influence matrix, 27685 surface nodes x 170 SAs
Afx-24-Jul-2023.csv
	Afx = Fx influence matrix, 27685 surface nodes x 170 SAs
Afy-24-Jul-2023.csv
	Afy = Fy influence matrix, 27685 surface nodes x 170 SAs
U-13-Apr-2023.csv
	U matrix, which gives Fz bending modes, 27685 surface nodes x 170 SAs
***_whp***
	same files as above, but with 176 columns, where the last 6 columns are for HPs, which have been treated the same way as the SAs
HP_xy.txt
	HP locations, in meter.
	(in M1B. Trupti gave me these by email 8/17/23. utility_mapping_M1B_labels-16-Feb-2023.xlsx has same data but outdated.)
NodeXYZsurface_meters.mat
	only data in here is 'NodeXYZsurface_meters', which gives x,y,z in meters of the 27685 surface nodes
	(swap x/y to get to M1B, see Trupti email on 8/18/23)
XYBendingModes_GMT.npy
	XY bending mode data created using Trupti's Afx and Afy, but with SVD done by Bo after removing the columns for single-axis SAs
SA_ID_for_IF.txt
	list of actuators whose influence functions will be tested in Section 9, with priority ranked high to low
	this list was provided by Trupti prior to the Optical Test Readiness Review
SA_IF_BM_coeff.txt
	Each row corresponds to one single-actuator influence function; each row has 162 bending mode coefficients
	(162 = 165 actuators - 3 constrained DOFs (dz, Rx, Ry) )
	4/2/24: for now these are decomposed onto the bending modes provided by RFCML. To be updated before testing.
BM_amp_sec10.txt
	amplitude of the axial bending modes to be applied for bending mode testing (Section 10 of the test plan)
	See Section 10 for descriptions of the data columns
	4/2/24: for now these are derived for the bending modes provided by RFCML. To be updated before testing.
Ux-27-Jul-2023.csv
Vx-27-Jul-2023.csv
Sx-27-Jul-2023.csv
Uy-27-Jul-2023.csv
Vy-27-Jul-2023.csv
Sy-27-Jul-2023.csv
	X influence function = Ux Sx Vx^T
	Y influence function = Uy Sy Vy^T
XYBendingModes_GMT.npy
    To be loaded as follows:
	    with open(filename, 'rb') as f:
    	    Ux90 = np.load(f)
        	Sx90 = np.load(f)
	        Vx90 = np.load(f)
	        Uy90 = np.load(f)
	        Sy90 = np.load(f)
	        Vy90 = np.load(f)
	These are U,V,S for 90 triple-axis actuators only
		U has the bending modes, V,S give the force vectors
BM_amp_sec16.txt
	amplitude of the XY bending modes to be applied for XY bending mode testing (Section 16 of the test plan)
	Top: X bending modes
	Bottom: Y bending modes
	See Section 16 for descriptions of the data columns
Af_hp-07-Sep-2023.csv
	hardpoint influence functions
	Same format as the actuator influence functions, for example, Afz-13-Apr-2023.csv
HP2XYZ.txt
	Hardpoint transform matrix
	HP2XYZ * (HP force vector) = (net forces and moments)
HP_xy.txt
	hardpoint contact point coordinates in M1B, from Trupti's email.
HP_IF_demand_V.txt
	Hardpoint influence function outer loop demand vectors (see HP_IF.ipynb)
	These demand vectors produce push forces on the hardpoints; multiple the vectors by (-1) to get the pull forces on hardpoints
	The demand vector is the input to M1DCS, it is 6x1 (Fx, Fy, Fz, Mx, My, Mz)
	each demand vector produce one 400N force on one HP and zero for the other 5 HPs
----------data files from the DCS---------------
m1_force_distribution_matrix_conf.coffee
	K matrix. 
		N rows = 170 SAs * (Fx, Fy, Fz) for each SA = 510
		N cols = net (Fx, Fy, Fz, Mx, My, Mz) seen by the HPs
