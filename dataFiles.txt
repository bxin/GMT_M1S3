-----------RFCML data files ---------------------------
actCoords.mat
	locations of the 165 SAs. in mm.
	(in ML CS, see Buddy email 8/18/23. swap x/y to get to M1B)
influenceFunctions.mat
	inside, we find
		"interactionMat", which is the surface normal influence matrix
		"forceMat", which is the unit load force sets
SVD.mat
	U, S, V matrices from the SVD of "interactionMat" above
nodeCoords.mat
	surface node coordinates, in mm.
	(in ML CS, see Buddy email 8/18/23. swap x/y to get to M1B)
saID_ml.txt
	SA IDs in the same order that they appear in the ML matrices.
	(Bo created this file by matching x and y locations if actCoords.mat to GMT SA locations.)

-----------GMT data files -----------------------------
utility_mapping_M1B_labels-16-Feb-2023.xlsx
	locations of the 170 SAs, types, max and min forces, air groups, etc. Do not use data from any other tabs, such as "HP"
	(in M1B CS,  see Trupti email on 8/18/23)
Afz-13-Apr-2023.csv
	Afz = Fz influence matrix, 27685 surface nodes x 170 SAs
Afx-24-Jul-2023.csv
	Afx = Fx influence matrix,
Afy-24-Jul-2023.csv
	Afy = Fy influence matrix,
U-13-Apr-2023.csv
	U matrix, which gives Fz bending modes, 27685 surface nodes x 170 SAs
***_whp***
	same files as above, but with 176 columns, where the last 6 columns are for HPs, which have been treated the same way as the SAs
HP_xy.txt
	HP locations, in meter.
	(in M1B. Trupti gave me these by email 8/17/23. utility_mapping_M1B_labels-16-Feb-2023.xlsx has same data but outdated.)
NodeXYZsurface_meters.mat
	only data in here is 'NodeXYZsurface_meters', which gives x,y,z in meters of the 27685 surface nodes
	(swap x/y to get to M1B, see Trupti email on 8/18/23)
XYBendingModes_GMT.npy
	XY bending mode data created using Trupti's Afx and Afy, but with SVD done by Bo after removing the columns for single-axis SAs

----------data files from the DCS---------------
m1_force_distribution_matrix_conf.coffee
	K matrix. 
		N rows = 170 SAs * (Fx, Fy, Fz) for each SA = 510
		N cols = net (Fx, Fy, Fz, Mx, My, Mz) seen by the HPs
