------------Campaign 1---------
1/6: principal optics alignment
1/7: Sec5 initial surface measurement; add 2 suckulators
1/8: taping SA gap started night before; Restart suckulators around noon.
1/9: Sec6 iter1 correction forces calculated; GMT not ready to apply them
1/10: Sec6 iter1-6; will lower SA control boards into Lower Plenum later

1/13 Sec7. winner=2 measurements x (30 samples x 2s) = (60 samples x 2s)
1/14 Sec8. repeatability; steps 1-14 done
1/15 Sec8. repeatability finished 
1/16 Sec9. single SA Influence Functions; 
     [Sec 10 GMT BM 1-4 with +00+ measurements]
1/17 [Sec 10 GMT BM 5-6 with +00+ measurements]
     Sec 10 GMT BM 1-11 with +--+ measurements

1/21 Sec 10 GMT BM 12-27 with +--+ measurements

------------Campaign 2--------- All SA control boards lowered & holes sealed--------
1/27 Sec 10 GMT BM 25,26,27, ML BM 25,26,27
1/28 Sec 10 ML BM 1-17
1/29 Sec 10 ML BM 18-24, 
     Sec 9. single SA repeats 4 + 10 new ones
1/30 Sec 11 Optimization: 5 iter of RB+14BMs, to 60nm
1/31 Sec 11 Optimization: 9 iter of RB+27BMs, to 35nm; 
     Sec 14 disabling SAs but no unplugging

2/3 Sec 11, start from the 35nm surface, 6 iterations to 37nm 
    Sec 10 BM 28-30
2/4 Sec 10 BM 30-46
2/5 Sec 15 RB vs BM, z: +/-0.25mm, 8 iters, to 43nm, then 6 iters, to 41nm
2/6 Sec 15 RB vs BM, y: +/-0.50mm, 7 iters, to 38nm, then 7 iters, to 40nm 
2/7 Sec 15 RB vs BM, Rz: +/- 20" , 7 iters, to 51nm, then 8 iters, to 32nm

2/10 Sec 11 Optimization: no thermal compensations, to 51nm, but no setbacks
	--------by the end of the day, we found out that the SDTs have SA forces swapped
2/11 Sec 11 Optimization: 6 iterations, to 40nm; 6 iteration, to ??nm
	(after switching cables for single-double-triples)

-------------Campaign 3------(blocked nozzles; fixed SDTs; ML improved measurement cadence)
2/18 ---------no measurements: trouble on both test cell and ML software
2/19 Sec 11 Optimization, ignore setbacks due to T jumps
	later on 2/20 found out ML-GMTO interface problem with SDTs, data invalid
2/20 Sec 10 BMs: 1-6, 25
2/21 Sec 11 Optimization: start with Sec 5 initial forces; 27 modes; 17 iter, 37nm
--2/22-2/23 cell off, TCs on
2/24 Sec 10 BM: 7-27 (no 25)
2/25 Sec 10 BM: repeat 21,22, 25, then did 28-40
2/26 Sec 10 BM: repeat 21,22, 25, then did 41-46,
     Sec 16 X BM: 1-6
2/27 Sec 16 X BM: 7-10, Y BM: 1-10
     Sec 17 HP IF: 1-2
2/28 Sec 17 HP IF:
