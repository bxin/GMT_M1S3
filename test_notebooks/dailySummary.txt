     Sec9. single SA repeats 4 + 10 new ones
1/30 Sec11 Optimization: 5 iter of RB+14BMs, to 60nm
1/31 Sec11 Optimization: 9 iter of RB+27BMs, to 35nm;
     Sec14 disabling SAs but no unplugging

2/3 Sec11, start from the 35nm surface, 6 iterations to 37nm
    Sec10 BM 28-30
2/4 Sec10 BM 30-46
2/5 Sec15 RB vs BM, z: +/-0.25mm, 8 iters, to 43nm, then 6 iters, to 41nm
2/6 Sec15 RB vs BM, y: +/-0.50mm, 7 iters, to 38nm, then 7 iters, to 40nm
2/7 Sec15 RB vs BM, Rz: +/- 20" , 7 iters, to 51nm, then 8 iters, to 32nm

2/10 Sec11 Optimization: no thermal compensations, to 51nm, but no setbacks
	--------by the end of the day, we found out that the SDTs have SA forces swapped
2/11 Sec11 Optimization: 6 iterations, to 40nm; 6 iteration, to 44nm
	(after switching cables for single-double-triples)

-------------Campaign 3------(blocked nozzles; fixed SDTs; ML improved measurement cadence)
2/18 ---------no measurements: trouble on both test cell and ML software
2/19 Sec11 Optimization, ignore setbacks due to T jumps
	later on 2/20 found out ML-GMTO interface problem with SDTs, data invalid
2/20 Sec10 BMs: 1-6, 25
2/21 Sec11 Optimization: start with Sec5 initial forces; 27 modes; 17 iter, 37nm

--2/22-2/23 cell off, TCs on

2/24 Sec10 BM: 7-27 (no 25)
2/25 Sec10 BM: repeat 21,22, 25, then did 28-40
2/26 Sec10 BM: repeat 21,22, 25, then did 41-46,
     Sec16 X BM: 1-6
2/27 Sec16 X BM: 7-10, Y BM: 1-10
     Sec17 HP IF: 1-2
2/28 Sec16 Y BM repeats: 4, 9
     Sec17 HP IF: 3-6
     Sec18 decenter X

3/3  --no work done; SA problems
3/4  Sec18 decenter Y; prep for Sec19 PVT: move PMP to enable alignment around HP=(0,0,0,0,0,0)
     ------sealed AHU holes (D=6 inch), 54-->26 ---- Tomas has diagram showing which ones-------
3/5  Sec11 Optimization: Buddy requested to use BMs only toward the end.
     Sec15 RB vs BM: +0.25mm z
     ------sealed AHU holes, 26-->16
3/6  Sec19 PVT test run
     Sec15 RB vs BM: -0.25mm z
3/7  Sec19 PVT test run
     Sec15 RB vs BM: +0.5mm y, -0.5mm y

3/10 Sec15 RB vs BM: Rz: +/- 20" (with r^6 spherical residual)
3/11 Sec19 PVT
3/12 Sec15 RB vs BM: Rz: +/- 20"
3/13 ------Trupti gives design meeting presentation. Waiting on her to produce forces for next test
3/14 Sec20 horizon x forces -> temperature compensation was not done correctly (Buddy emailed)

3/17 Sec20 horizon y forces -> decided to have Bo write Section 20 test plan and redo it.
rest of the week - no testing, due to other Mirror Lab activities (casting etc) and the disturbances to thermal environment

3/24 Sec20 with +00+ measurements, and no optimization w 27 BMs;
         later found Fz had wrong sign, and Fz was not applied at all
3/25 Sec11 optimization with initial laser tracker measurements only.
3/26 Sec20 repeat.
3/27 no testing. Analyzing Sec20 and Sec17 data.
3/28 Sec17 repeat.
